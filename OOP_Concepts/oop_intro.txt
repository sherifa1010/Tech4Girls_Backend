Object-Oriented Programing is a programing that uses objects to represent data and methodsto
 manipulate the data.
it is also bene ficial for lage-scae software development and also gives better organization among 
developers.

Main principles in OOPS
1.Encapsulation;this is the combiningof attributes and functions that operate on data into a single unit known as object.
2.Inheritance;it allows anew class to inherit properties and behaviours from existing class.
3.Polymorphism;it allows objects of a different classes to be treated as objectsof a common superclass.it also gives
a singlew interface to represent different underlying datatypes.
4.Abstractions;it involves hiding complex implementation details necessary features of an object.

Benefits of oops in software development
1.Maintainability;changes made to one part of a program can often be done without affectingother parts and this 
also makes it easier to fix a software.
2.Modularity;it is use to manage and understand complex system easier.

Real world examples
1.Banking systems;when applying in bank,you  could have classes account,customer and transactions which allows a clear interactions while
maintaining security through encapsulation.
2.Game development;this platform might have order and product.inheritance can be used where different types of 
products like digital products inherit from a base product class.
